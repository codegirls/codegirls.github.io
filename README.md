# The Code Girls website

**Caution: This is somewhat *unfinished*.  There may be a few glitches here and there still.  But it's pretty!**

This is the source of the Code Girls website.

It is intended to be a landing page for all things Code Girls, with links to further information and resources. It should provide an overview of what we do, what's currently happening and how to contact us.

Further long-form content should go in a blog, which could also be hosted here. We haven't really had a blog yet, but it would be nice to announce things there, write articles for mentees and coaches alike and hopefully feature some articles by our mentees, detailing what we've been learning. If we update it regularely, we'd also have a "track record" of what we did... (Maybe we should import the posts from our Facebook feed? They are very short, though, so maybe put them onto a separate "announcements" page? Or a category? Not sure yet, these are just a few ideas...)
